# FileTransferAppUsingTCP
----------------

When the project opens, you will ask the customer for his first and last name. The customer will enter their first and last name.

You are asking the customer:
Please note the link with the file you want to send. Suppose we enter:
C:/Users/Sarkhan Rasullu/Desktop/my geyds.txt

Then you ask the client to re-enter the ip and port of the person (server) you want to send this image to:
We will enter in this order:
localhost:5678

There should be two points. This will split the message and get the thread and port you need:

And you will enter this ip port and send that file and after sending you will print a message that it was sent successfully.
